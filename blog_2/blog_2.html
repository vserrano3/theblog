            My Review!
        </h2>
    <p>K & M $$</p>
    <p>A great camera store with a HUGE selection of cameras (35 mm film, point and shoot film cameras, video cameras, polaroids, etc). The prices have a decently wide range depending one what type of camera (brand, aesthetic, etc) you're looking for. I was in the market for a new point and shoot camera and the staff was very nice and very patient while I looked around and asked questions.</p>
