   <h2>Val's Review</h2> 
   <p> Eliz DIgital $</p>
   <p> I whole heartedly believe everyone in this business deserves a raise something from the city; because not only is the prices for their photos service is fair and of high quality. It's just simply professional! I walked in I was immediately greeted by an employee friendly and professionally! I walked out satisfied with my purchase and now a regular for this business. Thank you to everyone.
