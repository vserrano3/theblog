   <p>Digital offers reasonable prices and quick turnaround times. It's a straightforward process there. They develop your film and email it via a convenient WeTransfer link. You also have the option to get prints done there too! Including getting your passport picture done. They also sell Polaroid films and other film stocks like Fujifilm, Kodak, Portra, and Cinestill. The only downside is that it's cash-only! </p>

   <h2>Val's Review</h2> 
   <p> Eliz Digital $</p>
   <p>
    Everyone in this business deserves a raise something from the city because not only are the prices for their photos, but the service is fair and of high quality. It's just simply professional! I walked in and was immediately greeted by a friendly and professional employee! I walked out satisfied with my purchase and am now a regular for this business. Thank you to everyone.
