        <P>Brooklyn Film Camera $$$</P>
        <p>The store itself is super cute and has top notch staff. They were approachable, not pushy at all, but rather seemed to have a genuine passion for the cameras and would be happy to just talk about the ones they had in stock all day. If Polaroids are your thing, I would definitely reccomend this store!</p>
